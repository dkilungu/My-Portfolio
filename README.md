# Projects #


Below is a snapshot of some of the techniques I have used or projects I have tackled before.

## Data Visualization ##

  * ### General Visualization Techniques
    * [Pyramid Plots with ggplot](https://github.com/dkilungu/My-Portfolio/tree/master/pyramid%20plots "pyramid ggplot") : These plots are important in visualizing data falling in two categories such as Correct /Wrong scores in a test.
  * ### R Shiny 

## Predictive Modelling ##
* [Overfitting in Polynomial Regression ](https://github.com/dkilungu/My-Portfolio/blob/master/Optimal%20Polynomial%20Degree.ipynb) : This is a guide on selecting the optimal polynomial regression model degree, to avoid overfitting.
